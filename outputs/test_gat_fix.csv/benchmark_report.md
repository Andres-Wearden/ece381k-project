## Design Rules & Recommendations

Based on the experimental results, we derive the following design guidelines:

1. 🏆 **Best for Accuracy**: test_gat_fix achieved 0.477 accuracy. This topology is recommended when prediction quality is the primary concern.

2. 🛡️ **Best for Robustness**: test_gat_fix achieved 1.000 robustness. Use this topology in environments with frequent failures or perturbations.

3. ⚖️ **Size Neutral**: Network size has minimal impact on accuracy (correlation: nan). Focus on topology design rather than scaling.

## Conclusion

The **test_gat_fix** topology achieved the highest final accuracy of 0.4772. 
However, the optimal choice depends on the specific application requirements:

- For maximum accuracy: Choose the topology with highest final accuracy
- For reliability: Choose the topology with highest robustness score
- For efficiency: Choose topologies with low network density but high accuracy
- For scalability: Consider topologies that maintain performance as network size increases
